# üõ†Ô∏è Terraform AWS Infrastructure Provisioning

This repository contains Terraform configurations for provisioning essential AWS infrastructure. The configurations are designed to create foundational resources, facilitating the deployment of cloud-based applications in a controlled and scalable environment.


---

## üìñ Overview

The Terraform scripts in this repository provision the following AWS resources:  

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Provides an isolated network environment.  
- **Subnet:** Allocates IP ranges within the VPC for resource deployment.  
- **Internet Gateway:** Enables internet access for the VPC.  
- **Route Table:** Configures routing to direct traffic to the internet gateway.  
- **Security Group:** Manages inbound and outbound traffic rules, allowing HTTP and SSH access.  
- **EC2 Instance:** Launches a basic virtual machine with public internet access.

These configurations are simple and can serve as a starting point for more advanced AWS infrastructure setups.

## üìù Prerequisites

To use the configurations in this repository, ensure the following prerequisites are met:  

1. **Terraform:** Install the latest version of [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).  
2. **AWS Account:** Have an AWS account with sufficient IAM permissions to provision the described resources.  
3. **AWS CLI:** Configure the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) with appropriate credentials.  
4. **SSH Key Pair:** Generate or use an existing SSH key pair to access the EC2 instance.

## üìã Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
https://github.com/Hatsuhinode/AWS_Infra_Configs_with_Terraform.git
cd AWS_Infra_Configs_with_Terraform
```


### 2. Initialize Terraform
Run the following command to initialize Terraform and download required providers:

```bash
terraform init
```


### 3. Customize Variables
Edit the `variables.tf` file to customize the resource configurations. Default values are provided, but you can override them based on your requirements.


### 4. Apply Configuration
To create the infrastructure, execute:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Review the planned changes, and type yes to confirm and provision the resources.


### 5. Access Resources
Once applied, the EC2 instance's public IP will be available in the Terraform output. Use your SSH key to connect:
```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your/private/key.pem ubuntu@<ec2-public-ip>
```


### 6. Destroy Infrastructure
To delete all resources created by Terraform:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Confirm the operation by typing yes.
